Code of Learning Dual-Camera Smooth Zoom via Decoupled Geometric-Photometric Data Synthesis

## 1.Abstract
<p align="center"><img src="./assets/intro.png" width="95%"></p>
When zooming between dual cameras on smartphones, prominent discontinuities in both geometric perspective and color rendition inevitably degrade the visual experience of users. To address this, we introduce the dual-camera smooth zoom (DCSZ) task, aiming to synthesize continuous intermediate frames for fluid zooming. However, directly applying existing video frame interpolation (VFI) models to this task is severely hindered by substantial domain gaps and the physical intractability of capturing real-world continuous ground truth. To this end, we propose a novel data synthesis framework to generate high-fidelity DCSZ training sequences, named ZoomGS v2. It explicitly decouples geometric trajectories and photometric transformations from 3D representation modeling, thereby enabling extensive data generation from easily accessible single-camera 3D scenes. Furthermore, we design ZoomFI, a specialized VFI network tailored to the DCSZ task, which leverages comple- mentary bidirectional optical flows for comprehensive dual-camera information fusion. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets of two mobile phones demonstrate that training with our constructed DCSZ data significantly improves the performance of various VFI models. Moreover, the proposed ZoomFI achieves state-of-the-art results in both quantitative metrics and visual quality. The datasets, codes, and pre-trained models will be publicly available.

### 2.1 ZoomGS v2

(a) Pipline of ZoomGS. ZoomGS models the scene with a Base Gaussians and use CamTrans Module to learn spatial and photometric transitions between the two endpoint 3DGS, and then transform the Base Gaussians to target Gaussians of virtual cameras for rendering.<br />
(b) Pipline of ZoomGS v2. ZoomGS v2 first calibrate distribution of camera and color parameters from small dual-camera data, and then applies them to Gaussians constructed from large single-camera data for 3D scene rendering. The producted example on the right illustrates that ZoomGS v2 generates images with better quality than ZoomGS
